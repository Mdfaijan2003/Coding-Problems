Hint
Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.*/

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int numSteps(string s)
{
  int steps = 0;

  
}
int main()
{

  return 0;
}
