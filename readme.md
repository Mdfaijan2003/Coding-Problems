Coding Problems..............
This repository contains coding problems that I solve regularly to strengthen my problem-solving skills, data structures, and algorithmic thinking.

The goal of this repository is not quantity, but clarity of thought, consistency, and improvement over time.

How This Repository Is Organized?
Problems are grouped by concept, not by day or platform.
Coding-Problems/

├── Arrays/
├── Strings/
├── LinkedLists/
├── Stacks_Queues/
├── Sliding_Window/
├── Two_Pointers/
├── Recursion/
├── Dynamic_Programming/

Each folder focuses on a specific concept or pattern.

📂 Folder Structure (Inside Each Topic)
Example: Arrays/
Arrays/
│
├── two_sum.cpp
├── max_subarray.cpp
└── README.md

Each topic folder contains:

✅ Problem implementations
✅ A small README explaining:
    The problem
    The approach
    Key learnings
    Mistakes or edge cases faced

📝 Problem File Format
Each solution file follows this structure:
Problem description (brief)
Approach explanation
Time & space complexity
Clean, readable code
I focus on writing understandable code, not just passing test cases.

Why This Repository Exists?
To build strong fundamentals in DSA
To develop a structured problem-solving mindset
To maintain a public record of consistent learning
To improve my ability to explain technical solutions clearly

How I Use This Repository?
I solve problems regularly and push clean solutions Only meaningful problems or learnings are shared on LinkedIn

This repository acts as:
Proof of work
Reference for revision
Foundation for interview preparation

Platforms -->
Problems are solved from platforms like:
LeetCode
GeeksforGeeks
(Problem links are mentioned inside respective folders.)

Note-->
This repository reflects real learning, including:
Mistakes
Refactoring
Gradual improvement
The focus is on progress, not perfection.
